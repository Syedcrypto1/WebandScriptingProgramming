                <h3>Odd-Even Number Analyzer with Index-Based Power Calculation</h3>
                <p> I have created a program that allows users to analyze a series of integers they enter. It prompts users to input numbers one at a time and stops when they enter a termination value, which is -1. After the input is complete, the program sorts the numbers into two groups: odd and even. It then calculates the average of each group, ensuring that if there are no entries in one category, it handles that gracefully by returning an average of 0.

                    Additionally, the program raises each number to the power of its index in the list, which shows how each number changes based on its position. Once the calculations are done, the program displays the averages of both odd and even numbers along with the list of numbers raised to their respective indices. Finally, it gives users the option to start the process over with a new set of numbers, making it easy to perform multiple analyses without needing to restart the program. This interactive tool is designed to provide insights into number properties while keeping the user engaged.</p>
